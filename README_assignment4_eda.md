# Assignment 4 — EDA

This repository contains my EDA for Assignment 4.

## Contents
- `notebook.ipynb` — main Jupyter notebook (start from `assignment4_eda_template.ipynb`)
- `data/` — place your dataset here (CSV)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to run
1. Create a virtual environment and install requirements (pandas, matplotlib).
2. Put your CSV under `data/` and update the path in the notebook.
3. Run all cells.

## Deliverables
- Univariate histograms/bar charts for all variables (with stats & outliers)
- One combined boxplot of all numerical variables
- Scatter matrix for numerical variables
- Categorical vs categorical (crosstab/stacked bars)
- Categorical vs numerical (grouped boxplots)
- Aggregations (grouped statistics)
- Export a cleaned CSV for Tableau
